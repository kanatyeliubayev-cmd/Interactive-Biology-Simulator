## 🔬 About The Project

Traditional science education often relies on static textbook diagrams and abstract descriptions, making it difficult for students to build a true intuition for complex processes like cellular respiration or protein synthesis.

This project aims to transform learning by creating an interactive 3D environment where users can directly manipulate and observe biological systems in action. Leveraging my background in Neuroscience and my passion for game development, this simulator is built not just as a game, but as an educational tool grounded in principles of cognitive science to enhance engagement, understanding, and long-term knowledge retention.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Interactive 3D Models:** Explore detailed, manipulable models of cells, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other biological structures.
*   **Process Simulation:** Visualize and interact with dynamic processes like Cellular Respiration and Photosynthesis step-by-step.
*   **Guided Learning Modules:** Follow structured lessons that explain complex topics in a clear, visual manner.
*   **Gamified Quizzes:** Test your knowledge through engaging, interactive challenges rather than traditional multiple-choice questions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **Game Engine:** Unity
*   **Programming Language:** C#
*   **3D Modeling:** Blender
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Project Goals & Roadmap

My goal is to develop this simulator into a robust educational platform that can be used as a supplementary tool in schools and universities.

*   ✅ **Core Simulation:** Foundational mechanics for object interaction and process visualization.
*   ⏳ **In Progress:** Developing the Cellular Respiration and Photosynthesis modules.
*   🎯 **Future Plans:**
    *   Implement an adaptive learning module that adjusts quiz difficulty based on user performance.
    *   Integrate VR/AR support for a more immersive learning experience.
    *   Conduct user studies to scientifically measure the educational effectiveness of the simulator compared to traditional methods.
